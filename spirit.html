            <p>In 1880 her younger sister Hermina died and it was at this time that the spiritual dimension of her life began to develop.</p>
            
            <p>Despite being fairly well-known in art circles of her surrounding, the limitation of being a woman artist in male-centric world of painting had an effect on her carreer after graduating from Royal Academy. Thus, she found a group of fellow women artist, called 'De Fem' ('Five'). In that circle they practiced <u><i>s√©ances</i></u>, which were rather <i>en vogue</i> at the time, and also the technique of automatic painting.</p>
            
            <p> In 1908 she met for the first time Rudolf Steiner, the founder of the Anthroposophical Society, who was on a visit in Stockholm. Rudolf Steiner initiated her to his own theories regarding arts, and would have a certain influence on her paintings later in life. Several years later, in 1920, she would meet him again in Goetheanum in Dornach in Switzerland, the headquarters of the Antroposophical Society. Between 1921 and 1930 she would spend long journeys at Goetheanum.</p>
